# Seminaarity√∂ - Robot Framework web testing

This is a raport about practising how to use Robot Framework web testing for a school assignment. The [tests folder](https://github.com/jummij/ohte-robot/tree/main/tests) contains six test files.


## Installation

Python is required to be installed. Install Python to PATH on Windows machines.
See [installation instructions](https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/blob/master/INSTALL.rst)

[python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
pip install robotframework
pip install robotframework-seleniumlibrary
pip install QWeb
[Browser drivers](https://www.selenium.dev/selenium/docs/api/py/index.html#drivers)

## Getting started

There are user guides and tutorials available for Robot Framework and for each Library that are used in the test cases. 

* [Keyword documentation SeleniumLibrary](https://robotframework.org/SeleniumLibrary/SeleniumLibrary.html)
* [Keyword documentation QWeb](https://help.pace.qentinel.com/qwords-reference/current/qwords/_attachments/QWeb.html#)
* [QWeb tutorial](https://github.com/qentinelqi/qweb_workshop)

To run test, use command:

```
robot testfile.robot
```

## 1. test.robot

[test.robot](https://github.com/jummij/ohte-robot/blob/main/tests/test.robot) was the first test file I made after skimming through guides. The test did not pass as I did not know how to accept cookies, yet.

## 2. test2.robot

[test2.robot](https://github.com/jummij/ohte-robot/blob/main/tests/test2.robot) navigates inside a website to a contact form. It uses simple keywords such as *Click Element* and *Title Should Be*. This time I have accepted cookies successfully.

Compare the differences:

*test.robot*, accepting cookies **did not** work:
```
Accept Cookies
        Wait Until Page Contains     Ennen kuin jatkat
        Select Frame     //*[@id="dialog"]
        Click Button      //body/ytd-app/ytd-consent-bump-v2-lightbox/tp-yt-paper-dialog/div[4]/div[2]/div[5]/div[2]/ytd-button-renderer[2]   
```

*test2.robot*, accepting cookies **works**:
```
Accept Cookies
        Get Web Element     //body/div[1]/div[1]/div[2]/span[1]/a
        Click Element     //*[@id="cmpbntyestxt"]
```

## 3. test3.robot

The previous two test files implement SeleniumLibrary whereas [test3.robot](https://github.com/jummij/ohte-robot/blob/main/tests/test3.robot) implements QWeb library. QWeb made wed testing even easier, as it did not need xpaths as locators, but instead uses string values as locators, e.g the text that we see on the website itself.

This test file goes one step further than the previous test file, and tries to fill the contact form. With the keyword VerifyText, the program can verify whether the expected results appear or not. Here we check for missing required fields.

## 4. test4.robot

[test4.robot](https://github.com/jummij/ohte-robot/blob/main/tests/test4.robot) tests register, login and account delete functions. In the beginning it tries to register with a taken username, which should prompt an error message. Registering with an available username and bot check should work fine, and so should account deletion.

## 5. test5.robot

[test5.robot](https://github.com/jummij/ohte-robot/blob/main/tests/test5.robot) features the keyword ClickUntil. The test clicks a certain button so long until it gets the expected value anywhere on the website (or until time runs out). This test clicks a button that generates a random number between 1 and 100.

## 6. test6.robot

[test6.robot](https://github.com/jummij/ohte-robot/blob/main/tests/test6.robot) uses the keywords OpenWindow, SwitchWindow and CloseWindow, which creates a new tab, switches to another tab and closes the current tab, respectively.
